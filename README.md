In this project I explored the need for unit tests to test for errors in code logic. This was done by utilizing the JUnit test cases for each class.
These tests also allow for me to make sure I am delivering on the system requirements. To achieve this, I designed the tests to specifically look 
for the end results of the requirements to see if they were implemented correctly. The overall approach was to take the established criteria and 
build up to it. THe first thing I did was to take the requirements and put them in commment section at the bottom. This allowed me to quickly 
referencce them whenever needed.
